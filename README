This is a simple sprite engine i've written in WebGL. To compile the javascript correctly, you'll need some dependencies:

- BASH (sorry windows users)
- Java
- Python

Once you have these, just run ./setup.sh

You can run a temporary server in any of the example directories by running ./run_server.sh
