FEATURES
- Single javascript file to add WebGL sprite engine to any page
- Tint the color and alpha of sprites extremely quickly
- Rendering text from font maps ( uses font maps made from http://fontmap.nodester.com/index.html)
- Built in keyboard/mouse support to reduce having to make common code

GETTING STARTED

1) Download the compiled javascript library at: 
https://github.com/downloads/richardanaya/WebGLSpriteEngine/SpriteEngine-min.js

2) Go through the simple tutorials at: 
https://github.com/richardanaya/WebGLSpriteEngine/wiki/Tutorials

3) Check out some working demos at:
http://2d.nodester.com/index.html

COMPILING
To compile the javascript library correctly, you'll need some dependencies:

- Java ( http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp )
- Python ( http://www.python.org )

Once you have these, from commandline in the root directory run ./setup.sh (for osx/linux) or setup.bat (for windows)

TESTING
You can run a temporary server in any of the example directory by running ./run_server.sh after you have compiled

TODO LIST:
- improve how inputs work
- figure out a good solution for preloading images
- experiment with ways to do glow and blur
- animated spritesheets
- add layering
